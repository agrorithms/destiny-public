# Tests

## Running them

```bash
npm test              # everything, once. Fast, hermetic, no network.
npm run test:watch    # re-runs on save
npm run test:coverage # adds a coverage table. No thresholds — it's a diagnostic, not a gate.

npx vitest run tests/db/leaderboard.test.ts   # one file
npx vitest run -t 'checkpoint'                 # tests whose name matches
```

Browser tests are a separate runner and a separate command — see the table below
and `docs/handoffs/260803-playwright-e2e.md`:

```bash
npm run e2e           # build, then drive Chromium
npm run e2e:nobuild   # skip the build (fast; wrong if .next is stale)
```

`npm run e2e` pins a dummy `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNGIE_PUBLIC_API_KEY` into the build. Next inlines
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` at *build* time, so it has to be on `next-build` and cannot be set from
`playwright.config.ts`; without it `getPublicApiKey()` throws before the Bungie stub fires and
the client-write specs fail on a fresh clone or in CI. A fake value is correct — every
bungie.net request is answered by the interceptor in `e2e/support/test-fixtures.ts`. Because
`e2e:nobuild` does not rebuild, it inherits whatever key the last build baked in.

`npm test` is meant to stay fast and reachable from anywhere. It never touches the network and
never touches the real database — if it ever does either, that's a bug in the test, not a
tolerable shortcut.

## `npm test` vs `npm run e2e` vs `npm run e2e:maintenance`

Three different things that all deserve to exist.

| | `npm test` | `npm run e2e` | `npm run e2e:maintenance` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runner | Vitest | Playwright | A bespoke script |
| What | Unit and query-level tests | The app in a real browser | The maintenance-cycle harness |
| Speed | Under a second | ~10s plus a Next build | Minutes |
| Needs | Nothing | Chromium; builds and serves the app on port 3100 | Spawns real crawler/scanner processes against a mock Bungie server |
| In CI | Yes — `test.yml`, every push and PR | Yes — its own `e2e.yml`, `pull_request` + manual only | No — too slow, too many moving parts |

**File naming is what keeps the two test runners apart.** `.test.ts` is Vitest;
`.spec.ts` under `e2e/` is Playwright. Vitest's `include` lists its own
directories and its `exclude` names `e2e/**`; Playwright sets `testDir: './e2e'`
and `testMatch: '**/*.spec.ts'`. If a file ends up in front of the wrong runner it
fails with something that reads like a broken test — `Playwright Test did not
expect test.describe() to be called here` — rather than like a misplaced file.

`scripts/test-maintenance-cycle.ts` predates this framework and is correct for what it does. It is
not being ported or absorbed into Vitest. It was only renamed, from `test-maintenance-cycle` to
`e2e:maintenance`, so that `npm test` unambiguously means "fast, hermetic, no network".

## Layout

```

### `tests/helpers/` is shared by both runners

The Playwright suite seeds its fixture database through these same helpers, on
purpose: `seedRun` funnels through `insertFullPGCR`, so both suites agree on what
a seeded raid run is. A private e2e seeder would drift, and drift in *seeding* is
how a green suite ends up asserting against rows production could never create.

Two constraints follow, and breaking either produces an error nowhere near its
cause:

- **Never import from `vitest` in `tests/helpers/`.** Playwright loads these files
  too, and it has no `vi`, no `afterAll`. (This is why `tests/setup/test-db-path.ts`
  could not be reused for e2e — it imports `afterAll` — and `e2e/support/fixture-db.ts`
  reimplements the same technique instead.)
- **Use relative imports, not the `@/` alias.** Playwright's loader does not apply
  tsconfig `paths` when loading `globalSetup`; adding `baseUrl` does not change it.
  Relative paths resolve under both runners.

Colocated or under `tests/`? Colocate when the test needs nothing but the module — it moves with
the code it covers. Put it under `tests/` when it needs a database, a fixture, or a helper.

## The two ground rules

**Never mock our own modules.** `vi.mock('@/lib/db/queries')` tests the mock. The database is real
— `better-sqlite3` opens one in about a millisecond, faster than the mock scaffolding it replaces,
and it validates the actual SQL. See [ADR 0004](../docs/adr/0004-mock-only-at-the-network-boundary.md).

**Mock `fetch`, and only `fetch`.** `tests/setup/no-network.ts` replaces it with a thrower before
every test, so a test reaching the real internet fails loudly rather than quietly burning Bungie
API quota. Stub it deliberately when you need a response:

```ts
vi.stubGlobal('fetch', vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(new Response('{"ErrorCode":1}')));
```

No cleanup needed — the guard re-arms itself before the next test.

## Adding a test

**Pure logic** — colocate it, import directly, done:

```ts
// src/lib/crawler/pgcr.test.ts
import { processPGCR } from './pgcr';
import { buildPGCR, buildFireteam } from '../../../tests/helpers/pgcr-builder';

it('counts the run as completed when a single member finished', () => {
    const pgcr = buildPGCR({ entries: buildFireteam({ size: 6, completions: 1 }) });
    expect(processPGCR(pgcr).completed).toBe(true);
});
```

**Anything touching the database** — reset in `beforeEach`, seed through the helpers:

```ts
// tests/db/whatever.test.ts
import { resetTestDb } from '../helpers/db';
import { seedRun, seedPlayer, hoursAgo } from '../helpers/seed';

beforeEach(() => { resetTestDb(); });

it('excludes a checkpoint run', () => {
    seedRun({ instanceId: '1', completedBy: ['p1'], startedFromBeginning: false });
    expect(runLeaderboardRows(24, [], 10)).toEqual([]);
});
```

Each test file gets its own throwaway database in a temp directory, created with the production
schema. You don't have to set it up — `tests/setup/test-db-path.ts` handles it before your imports
run. A real file rather than `:memory:` for a specific reason:
[ADR 0003](../docs/adr/0003-tests-run-against-a-real-sqlite-file.md).

**`test-db-path.ts` must stay first in `setupFiles`, and `getDb()` enforces it.** `DB_PATH` in
`src/lib/db/index.ts` is a module-level const resolved at *import* time, so if anything imports the
db module before `test-db-path.ts` has pointed `DB_PATH` at the throwaway file, the whole suite
binds to the real database — and `resetTestDb()`'s `DELETE FROM`s land on your live dev data.
Don't reorder `setupFiles` in `vitest.config.ts` and don't convert `test-db-path.ts` into a helper
that some test imports. `getDb()` refuses to open anything but the throwaway DB while `VITEST` is
set, so a break fails loudly with `Refusing to open …` rather than silently destroying data.
`openMaintenanceDb()` is deliberately left unguarded — see ADR 0003 for why.

The same applies per-database: `assertDbPathAllowed()` takes a path and a sentinel, and the Archive
passes its own (`DFF_TEST_GOS10K_DB_SENTINEL`, minted in the same temp directory). A connection
added later without one would read the real file while every existing assertion still passed.

So if you ever see `Refusing to open … under Vitest`, that setup file didn't run before something
imported `src/lib/db` — check the `setupFiles` order rather than working around the error.

`seedRun` goes through `insertFullPGCR`, the same chokepoint all four production ingestion sources
use — so seeded rows are rows production could actually create. Don't reach for raw `INSERT`s.

**Fixtures or builders?** Fixtures when the point is "this is what Bungie really sends". Builders
when you need to vary one field across cases. See [fixtures/README.md](./fixtures/README.md).

**Anything touching the Archive** — build it, don't seed it:

```ts
// tests/db/archive-whatever.test.ts
import { buildFixtureArchive } from '../helpers/archive-seed';
import { closeArchiveDb } from '@/lib/db/archive';

beforeAll(() => { closeArchiveDb(); buildFixtureArchive(); });
```

The Archive (`src/lib/db/archive/`, [ADR 0007](../docs/adr/0007-the-archive-is-a-second-read-only-database.md))
is a frozen read-only artifact in production — a file copied into place, never written by the app
— so there is nothing to seed at runtime the way `seedRun` seeds the Tracker. `buildFixtureArchive()`
instead **writes a whole database** from `fixtures/archive-seed.json` into the second throwaway path
`test-db-path.ts` mints, and `getArchiveDb()` then opens it read-only exactly as production does.

Two things follow from the connection being a per-process singleton and the file being built rather
than emptied: build it in `beforeAll` rather than `beforeEach` (there is nothing to reset — no test
can write to it), and `closeArchiveDb()` first, because rebuilding the file under an open handle
leaves the old snapshot in memory.

The one exception is a test file that *destroys* the fixture to exercise a failure — deleting it to
check the missing-file error, or replacing it to check the manifest mismatch. Those rebuild in
`beforeEach`, because the previous test left no file to reuse. `tests/db/archive-connection.test.ts`
is the example; anything only *reading* the Archive wants `beforeAll`.

The seed is generated, not hand-written: `npm run extract-archive-fixture` pulls nine real runs and
their player and weapon rows out of the master, along with the master's own DDL, so the fixture
schema cannot drift. The nine are chosen for their hazards rather than for being typical — the run
whose flag says full clear but that the subject did not finish, the player who brought two
characters, the NULL name code, one run either side of the 2022-02-21 pin. Each carries its reason
in the file's `targets`. Regenerating needs the master, which lives only where the crawl was run.

`getArchiveDb()` skips its production row-count check for this file, because a nine-run sample
cannot satisfy a 13,420-row manifest. That check is tested directly in
`tests/db/archive-connection.test.ts` instead.

**The browser suite builds the same fixture, one row wider.** `e2e/support/archive-world.ts` calls
the same `buildFixtureArchive()` — unmodified, which is why `helpers/archive-seed.ts` and
`helpers/archive-replay.ts` must keep obeying the two `tests/helpers/` rules above — and then adds
one canary helper whose name carries a per-run nonce, so `e2e/support/archive-canary.setup.ts` can
prove through the running server which Archive it opened. That extra row is why the canary lives on
the e2e side rather than in this directory: the Vitest Archive has to stay byte-deterministic for the
`clear_number` ordinal assertions in `tests/db/archive-clear-number.test.ts`. If you are adding a
Vitest test that counts helpers or player rows, you are counting the seed's own rows and the e2e
canary is not among them. See [ADR 0003](../docs/adr/0003-tests-run-against-a-real-sqlite-file.md)'s
2026-09-07 amendment.

## Writing them

Name a test as a claim about behaviour, not a description of code. `excludes a run that nobody
completed` beats `test filter logic`. When you read a failure at 2am, the name is what you get.

Comment the *why* when it isn't obvious from the name — especially when a test pins behaviour
that's wrong but current. Those are labelled `BUG:` and say so in the comment, so nobody "fixes"
the test instead of the code.
