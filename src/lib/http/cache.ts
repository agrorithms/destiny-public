 * TEMPORARY — shortened for active UI iteration on /gos10k (issue #95, spec #81).
 *
 * The correct lifetime for a frozen dataset is long; 86400 is what this was and what it
 * goes back to. While Phase 1 is landing a panel at a time, a day-long browser cache means
 * a maintainer ships a change and then reviews yesterday's page. The lever is the lifetime,
 * not the directive: dropping `immutable` would change nothing, because a browser will not
 * revalidate inside `max-age` either way.
 *
 * RESTORE to 86400 once the /gos10k UI settles — tracked as the closing action on #81.

/**
 * For the Archive: a frozen, complete dataset whose last row was written before the
 * page existed and that will never gain another. This is the one place on the site
 * where a stale response is not a bug but the correct answer, so it gets a real
 * browser `max-age` and `immutable` rather than the `max-age=0, s-maxage=N` shape the
 * live routes use — there is nothing to revalidate.
 *
 * Setting it here is only half the story. Cloudflare cache rules, which are not in this
 * repo, rewrite what actually reaches the browser: a rule with no Browser TTL falls back
 * to a 4h zone default, which is how /api/live-stats once served max-age=14400 from a
 * repo that had never emitted a non-zero max-age. Check `cf-cache-status` and the header
 * prod returns before trusting this. See docs/decisions.md.
