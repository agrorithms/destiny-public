/**
 * The request-authenticity guard, exercised over real HTTP against the running
 * server. Issue #24.
 *
 * What this adds over what already exists. src/lib/http/request-auth.test.ts
 * covers the guard's *logic* (28 tests) and tests/routes/*.test.ts covers the
 * 403 branch by calling each exported POST directly with a spoofed-origin
 * NextRequest. Neither goes through the HTTP stack, and one thing lives only
 * there: middleware.ts matches `/api/players/:path*`, which covers all three
 * client-write endpoints, and its rate limiter runs *before* the route's guard.
 * A request rejected by middleware never reaches isTrustedClientWrite at all.
 * So every negative below asserts the response body, not just the status —
 * `{error:'Forbidden'}` is what distinguishes the guard's 403 from middleware's
 * 429 or 401. See issue #66 for the bucket question that finding raised.
 *
 * Every request here goes through APIRequestContext, not a page. The `test`
 * import is still the fixtures one, per the suite-wide convention that no spec
 * imports from '@playwright/test' directly — note that its network guard is an
 * `auto` fixture depending on `page`, so a browser page is still created per
 * test and nothing routes through it. Costs a little time, keeps one rule.
 *
 * No seeding. upsertPlayerFillOnly is a plain INSERT for a membership id the
 * database has not seen, so the positive control only needs an unused id.
