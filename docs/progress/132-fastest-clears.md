# #132 — Leaderboard: Fastest Clears tab ranked by Clear Time

Branch `feat/time-leaderboard`. Spec: `gh issue view 132`, parent `gh issue view 130`
(its Implementation Decisions, Testing Decisions and Out of Scope are authoritative).
Briefing from the peer session `orchestrate-time-leaderboard`.

Seams agreed with the user before any test:
1. the database seam — the new fastest-clear runner, in `tests/db/`, seeded with `seedRun`;
2. the browser seam — one new e2e spec, with the seeded world extended by runs of differing
   Clear Times.

No route tests and no cache-entry tests.

Settled: no minimum duration and no plausibility filter; a 2-minute run ranks like any other.
Out of this ticket: the raid.report link and date tooltip (#133), rank arrows / NEW / change
highlight on Fastest Clears (#134), anything from #131.

## Chunks

1. Server — runner, cache, route, DB tests
   - [x] `src/lib/cache/leaderboard-cache.ts` — `runFastestClearRows`, the `fastest` board's cache paths
   - [x] `tests/db/fastest-clears.test.ts` (new)
   - [x] `src/app/api/leaderboard/route.ts` — `board` parameter; maintenance body for `fastest`
2. UI — tabs, table, copy, maintenance message, e2e
   - [ ] `src/app/leaderboard/leaderboard-board.ts` (new) — the URL's spelling of the tab
   - [ ] `src/app/leaderboard/LeaderboardTabs.tsx` (new) — the tab strip
   - [ ] `src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx` — tab-aware fetch, heading, View toggle, maintenance message
   - [ ] `src/components/LeaderboardTable.tsx` — Clears or Clear Time column, per-tab empty state
   - [ ] `e2e/support/seed-world.ts` — runs of differing Clear Times
   - [ ] `e2e/leaderboard-fastest.spec.ts` (new)
3. Bookkeeping
   - [ ] `docs/progress/132-fastest-clears.md` (this file)
   - [ ] `docs/handoffs/260803-playwright-e2e.md` — covered-flows list

## Notes

- The DB tests were written one slice at a time, but the runner's SQL was complete after the
  first slice, so most later tests were green on first run. Each was then mutation-checked against
  the runner: dropping `pp.completed`, dropping the checkpoint conjunct, a window that keeps the
  slowest run, no end-time tie-break, no Players filter, dense ranking, a 300 s floor, and no raid
  filter each fail at least one test.
- The maintenance snapshot holds a Full Clears board only, so `board=fastest` during maintenance
  returns an empty `leaderboards` with `maintenance: true` (no snapshot read, so it never 500s for
  a missing snapshot).
