# PGCR fixtures

Real Bungie PGCR responses, captured verbatim on 2026-07-26. PGCR data is public, so these are
committed as-is. None are synthetic.

## Why captured, not hand-written

A hand-authored PGCR encodes what we *believe* the API returns. These fixtures exist to check that
belief, so writing them ourselves would defeat the point.

That is not a theoretical concern. Capturing these corrected three things we had wrong, each
inferred from the database rather than observed at the source:

- `startingPhaseIndex` is **present and always `0`**, including on confirmed checkpoint runs. We
  had assumed Bungie stopped sending it, because the writer's `|| 0` had flattened the evidence.
- A "six player" raid report can belong to **two people** with three characters each.
- "No derivable duration" was really **an absurd duration** — 27384s reported for an 18-minute run.

Use a fixture when the point is "this is what Bungie really sends". Use a builder from
`../helpers/pgcr-builder.ts` when you need to vary one field across several cases. Fixtures for
realism, builders for permutation.

## Capturing

```bash
npm run capture-fixtures
```

Reads `BUNGIE_API_KEY` from `.env` and rewrites every fixture below.

The script prints the salient fields for each capture — entry count, completion count,
`fromBeginning`, duration versus longest time played, missing names — so a fixture that no longer
demonstrates its stated case is visible rather than silently wrong. Check that output against the
table below whenever you re-capture. Bungie does eventually stop serving old PGCRs; if a capture
starts failing, pick a replacement instance and update `scripts/capture-pgcr-fixture.ts`.

Every instance ID was chosen by querying the production database for runs exhibiting the property
in question, so each is a real observed run rather than a hypothetical.

## Not a PGCR: `archive-seed.json`

`archive-seed.json` is the GoS 10k Archive fixture, and everything above about PGCRs applies to it
in spirit rather than in mechanism. It is 406 real Runs (2,481 player rows, 263 weapon rows)
extracted from the Archive master by `npm run extract-archive-fixture`, together with the master's
own DDL read from `sqlite_master` so the fixture schema cannot drift from the real one. Nine of the
Runs are `targets`, each carrying a `why` naming the hazard it exists for — the pin instant, a
`is_full_clear = 1` run the subject did not finish, a duplicate-character run, a NULL name code —
and the rest come from the `cohorts`, SQL-defined slices that give Phase 1's panels a population to
count. Weapon rows are pulled for the nine targets only.

Every data row is written on **one line**, deliberately: at four-space indent the player table alone
would run to some seventy thousand lines, and a committed fixture nobody can read the diff of is one
that changes without being reviewed. `tests/helpers/archive-seed.ts` builds a real SQLite file from
it; see ADR 0003's 2026-09-04 amendment and `../README.md`.

## The fixtures

| File | Instance | What makes it interesting |
|---|---|---|
| `pgcr-fullclear-salvations-edge.json` | 17091392013 | Baseline. Six players, six completions, started from the beginning. |
| `pgcr-checkpoint-root-of-nightmares.json` | 17091462346 | `activityWasStartedFromBeginning: false` — a checkpoint run, which every leaderboard must exclude. Seven entries. |
| `pgcr-zero-completions-vault-of-glass.json` | 17091467640 | No entry has `completed = 1`. The most common shape in the table: 55% of stored PGCRs. |
| `pgcr-partial-completion-last-wish.json` | 17091283535 | Two entries, one completion. `completed` is per-entry and ANY completion counts the run. |
| `pgcr-multi-character-garden.json` | 17091200569 | **Six entries, two distinct players** — three characters each. Also a mild Tier 1 vs Tier 2 duration gap (2069s reported, 2037s derivable). |
| `pgcr-absurd-duration-crotas-end.json` | 17091316490 | Reports a **27384s (7.6 hour)** duration for a run where nobody played past 1093s. The megalobby corruption `FUTURE_ENDED_SKEW_SECONDS` exists to reject. |
| `pgcr-missing-bungie-name.json` | 16975643976 | **Nineteen entries, every one anonymous** — `isPublic: false`, `membershipType: 0`, and no name field of any kind. Not "the global name is missing", but no identity at all. |
| `pgcr-non-raid.json` | 17091392014 | A non-raid activity, so `isRaidActivityHash` rejects it. Found by probing forward from a known raid instance. |

## Two cases with no fixture

**A checkpoint run identified by `startingPhaseIndex > 0`.** The original brief asked for this.
No such PGCR exists to capture — the field is `0` on every one of the 827,076 rows in production
*and* on every fixture above, including the three that are genuinely checkpoint runs. Checkpoint
runs are identified by `activityWasStartedFromBeginning` instead, which
`pgcr-checkpoint-root-of-nightmares.json` covers.

**A true Tier 3 run, where no duration is derivable at all.** Every captured PGCR reports a usable
`activityDurationSeconds`. `pgcr-absurd-duration-crotas-end.json` was originally captured expecting
this case — its database row has a NULL `ended_at` — but the NULL came from the future-end-time
guard rejecting a corrupt duration, not from Tier 3. Tier 3 is covered by builders in
`tests/db/ended-at-derivation.test.ts`.

Note that the absurd-duration fixture's NULL-ness is **time dependent**: the guard compares against
the ingest clock, so re-seeding that run today produces a non-NULL `ended_at`. Do not write a test
asserting NULL from that fixture — use a builder, which controls the period explicitly.
